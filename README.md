## About

This bundle integrates the features of the responsive framework Foundation, from ZURB (thanks guys), into Symfony by providing templates, Twig extensions, services and commands. You can quickly setup a responsive theme for an interface for your project. It will have the "look'n'feel", the responsiveness and the simplicity of Foundation.

**BE AWARE: THIS BUNDLE WILL NOT ADD THE FOUNDATION FRAMEWORK BUT RATHER FEATURES FOR SYMFONY TO WORK WITH IT**

Demo available [here](http://florianbelhomme.com/flobfoundationdemobundle/).
